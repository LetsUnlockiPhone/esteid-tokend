Esteid-tokend version 3.13 release notes
--------------------------------------
Changes compared to ver 3.12

- Added support for additional hashes to solve Safari issues on macOS 10.12 (Sierra)
- Simplified and cleaned up the make process

Esteid-tokend version 3.12 release notes
--------------------------------------
Changes compared to ver 3.11

- Smartcardpp and openssl dependencies have been removed (this is an experimental lightweight version of the EstEID tokend driver that utilizes the Tokendâ€™s own primitive transaction interface instead of using smartcardpp)

- Since the driver now uses tokend-s own reader interface to connect, disconnect and communicate with the token, it is now less prone to create a situation where the whole service hangs due to Apple bug #21437286 "PC/SC SCardGetStatusChange() blocks forever after some time".



Esteid-tokend version 3.11 release notes
--------------------------------------
Changes compared to ver 3.10

- Changed install path from /System/Library/Security/tokend to /Library/Security/tokend since on OS X 10.11 the entire /System folder is write protected by the kernel.
